A real BWR lattice includes fuel assemblies with different enrichment zones, control rods, water gaps, and more complex geometries.  You'll need to significantly expand this code to model these features accurately.\n*   **Material Composition:** The material compositions are simplified. You need accurate nuclide densities for realistic simulations.  Use data from the ENDF libraries or similar.\n*   **Cross Sections:**  You'll need to specify the appropriate cross-section libraries (e.g., ENDF/B-VII.1) in your `settings.xml`.\n*   **Tallies:** Define tallies to measure quantities of interest, such as k-effective, power distribution, flux, etc.\n*   **Void Fraction:**  A crucial aspect of BWR simulations is the void fraction (steam content) in the moderator.  You'll need to model this explicitly, possibly using a multi-group approach.\n*   **Temperature Dependence:** The material properties (density, cross sections) are temperature dependent. You'll need to account for this temperature dependence for realistic results.\n\n\nThis expanded example provides a foundation.  Building a full BWR model is a complex undertaking requiring expertise in nuclear engineering and reactor physics.

To help you add more gadolinia, I need you to provide the relevant sections of your input file.  Specifically, I need to see how you're currently defining your materials and geometry.\n\nHowever, I can give you general guidance on how to increase the gadolinia concentration in your OpenMC simulation:\n\n**Methods for Adding More Gadolinia:**\n\n1. **Modifying Material Definition:**  The most straightforward method is to adjust the atom densities or weight fractions of Gd in your material definition.  This typically involves changing a line within your `materials.xml` file.  Look for a material containing gadolinia (e.g., `Gd2O3` or a fuel material with Gd).  You'll see something like this:\n\n   ```xml\n   <material id=\"1\" name=\"UO2\">\n       <nuclide density=\"0.0445\">U235</nuclide>\n       <nuclide density=\"0.9555\">U238</nuclide>\n       <nuclide density=\"1.0\">O16</nuclide>\n   </material>\n\n   <material id=\"2\" name=\"Gd2O3\">\n       <nuclide density=\"1.0\">Gd155</nuclide> <--- This needs adjustment likely\n       <nuclide density=\"1.0\">Gd157</nuclide> <--- and this one as well\n       <nuclide density=\"1.0\">O16</nuclide>\n   </material>\n   ```\n\n   To increase the gadolinia concentration, you need to increase the `density` values of the Gadolinium isotopes (Gd155 and Gd157 are the most important neutron absorbers).  You might need to adjust the oxygen density accordingly to maintain the stoichiometry of Gd2O3.  Remember to recalculate the densities to match your desired weight percent or atom fraction of Gd2O3.\n\n2. **Adding Gadolinia to Fuel:** If the gadolinia is mixed within the fuel, you adjust the densities directly within the fuel material definition.  For example:\n\n   ```xml\n   <material id=\"1\" name=\"UO2_Gd\">\n       <nuclide density=\"0.044\">U235</nuclide>\n       <nuclide density=\"0.95\">U238</nuclide>\n       <nuclide density=\"1.0\">O16</nuclide>\n       <nuclide density=\"0.005\">Gd155</nuclide>  <-- Increase this density\n       <nuclide density=\"0.01\">Gd157</nuclide>  <-- Increase this density\n   </material>\n   ```\n\n3. **Modifying Geometry:** If you have distinct gadolinia regions (e.g., burnable absorber rods), you may need to modify the geometry description in your `geometry.xml` file.  This might involve increasing the size or number of these regions to achieve the desired gadolinia concentration in the overall system.\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n* **Mass Balance:**  Always ensure that the total number of atoms in your material definitions is consistent.\n* **Weight Percent vs. Atom Fraction:** Make sure you understand whether you are specifying the gadolinia concentration in weight percent or atom fraction and adjust the densities accordingly.  You might need to use a molar mass calculator to convert between them.\n* **Isotopic Composition:**  Be mindful of the isotopic composition of natural gadolinium. Gd155 and Gd157 are the most important isotopes for neutron absorption, so you should specify those individually.\n* **Normalization:** The `density` values in OpenMC are typically atom densities (atoms/barn-cm).  Ensure your densities are correctly normalized.\n* **Verification:** After making changes, always re-run your simulation and verify that the results are reasonable. Check the gadolinia concentration in the tallies to ensure it matches your intended value.\n\n**To get specific help, please provide:**\n\n* **The relevant sections of your `materials.xml` file.**\n* **The relevant sections of your `geometry.xml` file (if the gadolinia distribution is geometrically complex).**\n* **The desired gadolinia concentration (weight percent or atom fraction).**\n\nWith this information, I can provide much more tailored and helpful advice.\n"}]
