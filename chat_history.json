[{"role": "user", "content": "what is OpenMC?"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "OpenMC is a  Monte Carlo code that simulates the transport of neutral particles, specifically neutrons and photons, through a defined model.  This model can represent anything from a simple metallic sphere to a complex nuclear reactor.  The simulation tracks the particles stochastically as they interact with the materials in the model. [Source: A Beginner's Guide to OpenMC, \"What does OpenMC do?\"]\n\nTo effectively use OpenMC, familiarity with the command line interface and Python programming is recommended, as OpenMC provides a comprehensive Python API which simplifies the process compared to using raw XML input files. While not strictly required, Git is beneficial for managing code updates and contributions. [Source: A Beginner's Guide to OpenMC, \"What do I need to know?\"]\n"}]
