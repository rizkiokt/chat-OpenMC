This example uses a rectangular lattice for simplicity; a hexagonal lattice would require more complex geometry definitions.  Remember that a realistic BWR model would be significantly more complex, requiring detailed fuel pin geometries, control rod models, and water gaps.\n\n\nThis script is based on the examples provided in the OpenMC documentation, specifically the sections on building lattices using the Python API. (OpenMC User's Guide, Section: Python OpenMC examples)\n\n\n```python\nimport openmc\nimport numpy as np\n\n# Define materials (simplified for demonstration)\nfuel = openmc.Material(1, name='UO2')\nfuel.add_nuclide('U235', 3.0/1000)\nfuel.add_nuclide('U238', 96.7/1000)\nfuel.add_nuclide('O16', 4.8)\nfuel.set_density('g/cm3', 10.3)\n\nwater = openmc.Material(2, name='H2O')\nwater.add_nuclide('H1', 2.0)\nwater.add_nuclide('O16', 1.0)\nwater.set_density('g/cm3', 1.0)\n\nmaterials = openmc.Materials([fuel, water])\nmaterials.export_to_xml()\n\n# Define cells (simplified fuel and moderator)\nfuel_cell = openmc.Cell(1, fill=fuel)\nmoderator_cell = openmc.Cell(2, fill=water)\n\n# Define universes\nfuel_universe = openmc.Universe(1, name='Fuel Universe')\nfuel_universe.add_cell(fuel_cell)\nmoderator_universe = openmc.Universe(2, name='Moderator Universe')\nmoderator_universe.add_cell(moderator_cell)\n\n# Define lattice\nlattice = openmc.RectLattice(lattice_id=1)\nlattice.dimension = [5,5] # 5x5 lattice for demonstration\nlattice.pitch = [1.0, 1.0] # cm, adjust as needed for BWR geometry\nlattice.lower_left = [-2.5, -2.5] # cm, adjust to match pitch\n#Simple fuel arrangement, replace with a more realistic BWR arrangement\nlattice.universes = [[fuel_universe] * 5 for _ in range(5)]\n\n\n# Create a root universe and cell\nroot_universe = openmc.Universe(universe_id=0, name='root universe')\nroot_cell = openmc.Cell(cell_id=0, fill=lattice)\nroot_universe.add_cell(root_cell)\n\n\n# Define geometry\ngeometry = openmc.Geometry(root_universe)\ngeometry.export_to_xml()\n\n#  Simple settings for demonstration - Replace with your own settings\nsettings = openmc.Settings()\nsettings.batches = 10\nsettings.inactive = 5\nsettings.particles = 1000\nsettings.source = openmc.Source(space=openmc.stats.Point((0,0,0)))\nsettings.export_to_xml()\n\n\n```\n\nThis script creates a simplified 5x5 BWR lattice with fuel pins and moderator.  You would need to significantly expand upon this model to represent a real-world BWR, incorporating:\n\n* **More realistic fuel pin geometry:** Include cladding, gaps, and possibly different enrichment zones.\n* **Control rods:** Model control rod insertion and their effect on reactivity.\n* **Water channels:** Accurately represent the flow channels for coolant.\n* **Hexagonal lattice:** Use `openmc.HexLattice` for a more accurate representation of the fuel assembly geometry.\n* **Realistic material compositions:** Use accurate nuclear data for all materials.\n* **Boundary conditions:**  Consider using reflective boundary conditions on the sides and vacuum at the top and bottom.\n\n\nRemember to install OpenMC (`pip install openmc`) before running this script.  After running, you will have the necessary XML files to run an OpenMC simulation.  Remember to adjust parameters to reflect the true dimensions and fuel composition of your target BWR design.\n"}]
